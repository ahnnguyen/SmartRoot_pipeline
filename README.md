# SmartRoot pipeline

This pipeline has been designed to visualize maize lateral root growth data extracted with the [SmartRoot ImageJ plugin](https://smartroot.github.io/).

## 1.Rstructuration of SmartRoot files

In a first step, basic features are computed for individual roots of single root system image series, such as their root ages or daily root elongation rates. Input files to be provided are SmartRoot datasets **Global Root Data**, providing information about individual roots, and **Root Nodes**, providing information about individual node, both located under the `data/SR_files` directory. The date and time associated to each image acquisition must be provided in a separate .csv file, located under the `data/Auxiliary_files` directory.
